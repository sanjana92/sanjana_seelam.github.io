## 🧠 About Me

I’m a results-oriented **SOC Analyst** with 5+ years of real-time experience protecting enterprise and cloud infrastructure from evolving cyber threats. I bring together a unique mix of:

- 🔍 Deep expertise in **SIEM tuning & threat detection (Microsoft Sentinel, KQL)**
- ⚙️ Automation of security workflows using **PowerShell, Python & SOAR**
- ☁️ Experience in **Azure security, Defender XDR, IAM, and compliance (NIST 800-53, CIS)**  
- 🧩 Passion for **forensics, malware analysis**, and collaborative incident response

I don’t just detect threats — I reduce noise, accelerate response, and improve SOC efficiency.
