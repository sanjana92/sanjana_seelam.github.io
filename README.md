# 👋 Hi, I'm Sanjana Seelam

### 🚀 SOC Analyst | Threat Hunter | Cloud Security | Incident Responder | Cybersecurity Enthusiast

🧠 I’m Sanjana, a dedicated SOC Analyst with over 5 years of experience monitoring and defending enterprise-scale infrastructures. I specialize in **cloud-native security**, **SIEM analytics**, and **incident response** using Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for 365, and KQL scripting.

🔍 I thrive in fast-paced environments solving real-world threats — from phishing to privilege escalations — and have developed SOAR automations that saved over 200 analyst hours annually. I’m passionate about building scalable, automated threat detection systems that help teams respond faster and smarter.

🧪 In my free time, you’ll find me sharpening my skills on **TryHackMe**, publishing GitHub security projects, and mentoring fellow security engineers through walkthroughs and threat hunt playbooks.
